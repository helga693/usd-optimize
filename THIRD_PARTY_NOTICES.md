# Third-Party Notices

**Usd Optimize Core** is Copyright (c) 2020-2026, NVIDIA CORPORATION and is licensed
under the Apache License, Version 2.0. See the `LICENSE` file at the root of this
repository for the full product license text, or
https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0 for the canonical Apache 2.0 license.

This product includes software developed by third parties and/or by NVIDIA. The required
copyright notices, attribution statements, and license texts for those components are
provided below.

The list of components below reflects the build-time and run-time dependencies
declared in `deps/target-deps.packman.xml` (which transitively imports
`deps/usd-deps.generated.packman.xml` and, for USD-version-specific libraries,
`deps/usd-lib-deps.generated.packman.xml` sourced from `deps/usd-lib-deps.json`).
Version strings match the packman package pins for the default USD 25.11 build unless
noted otherwise.

# 3rd Party Open Source Components

## Pixar Animation Studios - OpenUSD - Tomorrow Open Source Technology License 1.0

Component: `usd-${config}` (version 25.11; packman package
`0.25.11-gl.18041+v25.11.363a7c8d`)

Attribution Statements: The proprietary code links against OpenUSD shared libraries and
uses its C++ and Python APIs pervasively. The core library reads, writes, traverses, and
mutates USD stages. Every operation plugin receives USD prims/stages as input, processes
them, and writes results back through USD APIs. Python extensions also use `pxr` modules
directly. Source code is available at https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/OpenUSD.
The full upstream `LICENSE.txt` (which also enumerates the OSS components bundled inside
OpenUSD itself, e.g. RapidJSON, double-conversion, OpenEXR/Half, libdeflate, LZ4, stb,
pugixml, pbrt, Draco, Roboto fonts, Spirv Reflect, khrplatform.h, Tessil robin-map,
CLI11, PEGTL, LibAvif, libaom, boost, etc.) is the authoritative source for those
embedded notices.

original Apache License 2.0 in the following manner. Section 6 ("Trademarks")
is different.

## Intel Corporation / UXL Foundation - oneTBB (Threading Building Blocks) - Apache License 2.0

Component: `oneTBB` (transitive, bundled with OpenUSD)

Attribution Statements: The proprietary code links against TBB and calls its parallel
algorithms (e.g. `tbb::parallel_for`, `tbb::parallel_reduce`) directly from C++ source to
parallelize mesh processing, spatial analysis, and other compute-heavy operations. TBB is
also a transitive runtime dependency of OpenUSD itself. Source code is available at
https://github.com/uxlfoundation/oneTBB.

## Wenzel Jakob - pybind11 - BSD 3-Clause License

Component: `pybind11` (version 2.11.1-0)

Attribution Statements: The proprietary code includes pybind11 headers and uses its
macros/types to define Python binding modules that expose the C++ usd optimize API to
Python. This is a compile-time, header-only interaction. Source code is available at
https://github.com/pybind/pybind11.

## Eigen - Mozilla Public License 2.0

Component: `Eigen` (transitive, bundled inside the `autouv-core` NVIDIA package)

Attribution Statements: The proprietary code does not include Eigen headers directly.
Eigen is bundled inside the `autouv-core` NVIDIA package and used internally by that
library for linear algebra. Usd Optimize depends on `autouv-core` at the shared
library level, so Eigen is a transitive, indirect dependency. Source code is available
at https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen.

License Text(https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/)

```
Eigen is primarily MPL2 licensed. See COPYING.MPL2 and these links:
http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/
http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/FAQ.html

Some files contain third-party code under BSD or LGPL licenses, whence the other
COPYING.* files here.

All the LGPL code is either LGPL 2.1-only, or LGPL 2.1-or-later.
For this reason, the COPYING.LGPL file contains the LGPL 2.1 text.

If you want to guarantee that the Eigen code that you are #including is licensed
under the MPL2 and possibly more permissive licenses (like BSD), #define this
preprocessor symbol: EIGEN_MPL2_ONLY
```

## Viktor Kirilov - doctest - MIT License

Component: `doctest` (version 2.4.5+nv1-3)

Attribution Statements: The proprietary test code includes doctest headers and uses its
macros (`TEST_CASE`, `CHECK`, etc.) to define and run C++ unit tests. This is a test-only,
compile-time dependency and is not present in shipped binaries. NVIDIA actively chooses
the MIT license to apply to files with this copyright and license. Source code is
available at https://github.com/doctest/doctest.

License Text(https://github.com/doctest/doctest/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)

# Notes

* This file enumerates the packages declared in `deps/target-deps.packman.xml` (and the
  USD/Python imports it pulls from `deps/usd-deps.generated.packman.xml`, plus
  USD-version-specific libraries from `deps/usd-lib-deps.generated.packman.xml`).
  Build-host-only and developer tooling dependencies (`deps/host-deps.packman.xml`,
  `deps/repo-deps.packman.xml`, and the optional `deps/repo-deps-nv.packman.xml`
  side-car) are not included here because they are not redistributed with the product.
* **`omnimesh_ops_usd`, `autouv-core`, and `shrinkwrap_openvdb`** are pinned per OpenUSD
  version in `deps/usd-lib-deps.json` (currently 25.11 and 25.05). The entries above
  describe the default 25.11 build; consult that file for the exact packman strings when
  building against 25.05.
* **Python (CPython, PSF License)** is pulled in via `deps/usd-deps.generated.packman.xml` as a
  host-environment dependency used only for building the pybind11 bindings. The CPython
  interpreter is not redistributed as part of Usd Optimize Core (consumers supply
  their own Python runtime), so it is intentionally omitted from the OSS attribution
  list above. If a downstream product bundles the CPython runtime sourced from this
  package, that product must add the PSF License attribution to its own notices file.
* For each NVIDIA-distributed package above, the canonical and most up-to-date copyright,
  license, and embedded third-party notices are the ones shipped inside that package
  (typically as `LICENSE`, `LICENSE.txt`, or `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES`). The entries here are a
  product-level summary intended to satisfy the OSS attribution requirement at the level
  of the Usd Optimize Core distribution.
