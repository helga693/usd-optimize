Command Line Interface Tool
===========================

Usd Optimize provides a command line interface (CLI) tool under
``bin/usdOptimize`` that allows you to run optimization operations on USD files
without writing any code.

.. Note:: **On Windows, run** ``bin\usdOptimize.bat``, not ``usdOptimize.exe``.
   The ``.bat`` sets up the library path; the bare ``.exe`` exits
   ``-1073741515`` (``STATUS_DLL_NOT_FOUND``). Name it explicitly, since
   ``PATHEXT`` resolves ``.exe`` first.

CLI usage is as follows:

.. Note:: The native CLI runs the built-in (C++) operations only, which is why
   the operation list below is a subset of the full :doc:`operations` catalog.
   The Python-plugin operations (``pythonScript``, ``deleteHiddenPrims``,
   ``removeUntypedPrims``, ``moveMaterials``) are unavailable here because the
   CLI binary does not initialize a Python interpreter; use the ``usd-optimize``
   Python wheel / bindings to run them.

    Usage: usdOptimize [OPTIONS] input-stage

    Required Args:
      -i [ --input ] arg    The input stage to read

    Optional Args:
      -h [ --help ]                       Print this help
      -h [ --help ] operation             Print help specific to an operation

      -a [ --argument ] argument=value    Specify an argument for an operation, along with its value. Any arguments apply
                                          to the most recent operation that was specified. Array values can be specified by
                                          using a comma separated list.
      -an [ --analysis ]                  Run in analysis mode (unsupported operations will be skipped)
      -c [ --config ] arg                 JSON commands file
      -fl [ --flatten ]                   If enabled, flattens the stage before outputting, otherwise only exports the root
                                          layer.
      -j [ --json ] filename              Write any operation configuration to the specified JSON file
      -o [ --operation ] operation        Add an operation. Multiple operations can be specified, and will execute in the
                                          order they are provided. Adding arguments will apply to the most recently
                                          specified operation
      -r [ --report ]                     If enabled, generate a report describing what was done, warnings, etc
      -s [ --stats ]                      Capture stage stats before/after operations
      -rp [ --relativePaths ]             After exporting a stage, check for any asset paths that can be made relative
      -st [ --singleThreaded ]            Disable multi-threading in operations that support this option
      -v [ --verbose ]                    Enables verbose mode (extra stats, more logging, etc)
      -w [ --write ] filename             The output stage to write
