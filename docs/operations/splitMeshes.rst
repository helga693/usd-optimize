============
Split Meshes
============

**Key**: ``splitMeshes``

This operation finds meshes that contain multiple disjoint pieces (parts that share no
vertices) and replaces them with separate mesh prims, one per connected piece. It is the inverse of
:doc:`Merge Static Meshes<merge>` and is useful for debugging, isolating spatial outliers, and letting a
renderer cull pieces independently.

Starting configurations
-----------------------

Split disjoint pieces into separate prims:

.. code-block:: json

    [{"operation": "splitMeshes", "splitOn": 0}]

Split and re-cluster spatially by vertex count:

.. code-block:: json

    [{"operation": "splitMeshes", "spatialMode": 2, "spatialVertexCount": 50000}]

Merge boundaries
----------------

``mergePoint`` selects the boundary that meshes are grouped under. Only meshes sharing a boundary are
merged with each other, and the result is written under that boundary. Callers driving the operation
from JSON, the CLI or the API pass the integer value.

   ===== ================== ================================================================================
   Value UI label           Merge boundary
   ===== ================== ================================================================================
   0     Stage              The pseudo-root, so the whole stage is a single boundary (default)
   1     Parent Xform       The first parent typed ``Xform``
   2     Kind: Assembly     The first parent of kind ``assembly``
   3     Kind: Group        The first parent of kind ``group``
   4     Kind: Component    The first parent of kind ``component``, falling back to ``group``
   5     Kind: Model        The first parent of kind ``model``
   6     Kind: Subcomponent The first parent of kind ``subcomponent``, then ``component``, then ``group``
   7     Root Prim          Each root prim, that is each direct child of the pseudo-root
   8     Parent Prim        The first parent, whatever its type
   9     Original Prim      Each mesh itself, with results written beside the original rather than under it
   ===== ================== ================================================================================

Kinds are matched through the kind registry, so a mode also matches any kind derived from the one it
names. The values above are elective boundaries layered on top of the structural boundaries that
always apply: the pseudo-root, prims that are not ``def``, prims composed into an instanceable prim,
prims that reset the xform stack, and prims with a time sampled transform or visibility.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Maximum distance at which to consider meshes neighbors
