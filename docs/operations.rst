==========
Operations
==========

The following is the catalog of optimization operations provided by Usd Optimize.
Each operation is identified by a string **key** (shown with each entry) and
declares a set of typed arguments that are supplied as a JSON object / Python
dictionary.

For almost every operation, a ``paths`` (or ``meshPrimPaths`` / ``primPaths``)
argument selects which prims to process. **If left empty, the whole stage is
processed.** Path expressions are supported.

.. Caution:: Operations work against the current set of selected variants. To
   optimize multiple variants, apply optimizations to each variant
   individually — for example by externalizing the contents of each variant to
   separate USD assets, optimizing each, and referencing the results back into
   the desired variant compositions.

.. Note:: **Native CLI vs. Python host.** Most operations are built-in (C++)
   plugins available everywhere Usd Optimize runs. Four operations —
   ``pythonScript``, ``deleteHiddenPrims``, ``removeUntypedPrims``, and
   ``moveMaterials`` — are implemented as Python plugins. These require a
   Python-hosted runtime and are
   available through the ``usd-optimize`` Python wheel / bindings, but **not**
   from the standalone ``bin/usdOptimize`` CLI, which does not initialize a
   Python interpreter. Invoking one of them from the native CLI reports
   ``invalid operation specified``. See :doc:`cli` and :doc:`python`.
