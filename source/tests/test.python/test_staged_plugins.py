    """Assert every registered USD plugin can actually load from the staged tree.

    Plugins are registered from ``plugInfo.json`` without their binaries being
    touched, so one staged without its runtime dependencies stays invisible
    until something first demands it -- no load-time error, no warning.

    That is how the MaterialX staging gap survived: ``usd_usdMtlx`` was copied
    into ``extraLibs/`` from the USD package's ``lib/`` while the MaterialX
    runtime it links against lives in the package's ``bin/``, and nothing in Usd
    Optimize resolves shader nodes, so no test ever triggered the load. It only
    surfaced when an external harness ran ``usdchecker`` against a package.

    Forcing every plugin to load turns that whole class of staging gap into an
    immediate failure, and it does so in the configuration that matters: the
    suite runs from the ``usd_optimize_tests`` archive, which ships
    ``extraLibs/`` and not the USD package's ``bin/``.
