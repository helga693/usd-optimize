Merge Static Meshes
===================

**Key**: ``merge``

The merge static meshes operation replaces multiple meshes that
share common properties with a single merged mesh. This reduces scene prim count
and can improve overall stage performance.

Spatial clustering can further subdivide merges to keep merged meshes a
reasonable size. The supported spatial modes are: None (no spatial grouping),
BoundingBox (group meshes within a distance threshold, capping cluster size),
VertexCount (cap the vertex count per merged mesh), and CoincidentBoundary (only
merge meshes that share a seam).

In CoincidentBoundary mode two meshes are merged only when they share at least
boundaryMinSharedVertices boundary vertices that coincide in world space within
boundaryTolerance, where a boundary vertex is one lying on a boundary edge (an
edge used by exactly one face). Connectivity is transitive, so a chain of
abutting meshes collapses into one, while meshes that share no seam are left
untouched. This targets bad CAD output where a single part is exported as
several abutting pieces, such as a washer split into two half-rings.

Recommended pipelines
---------------------

Merge then ``computeExtents`` (to author bounds on the new prims); merge then ``shrinkwrap`` to turn a
group of parts into one watertight shell.

Starting configurations
-----------------------

Merge everything by material:

.. code-block:: json

    [{"operation": "merge", "considerMaterials": true}]

Spatial merge capped by vertex count:

.. code-block:: json

    [{"operation": "merge", "spatialMode": 2, "spatialVertexCount": 50000}]

Merge boundaries
----------------

``mergePoint`` selects the boundary that meshes are grouped under. Only meshes sharing a boundary are
merged with each other, and the result is written under that boundary. Callers driving the operation
from JSON, the CLI or the API pass the integer value.

   ===== ================== ================================================================================
   Value UI label           Merge boundary
   ===== ================== ================================================================================
   0     Stage              The pseudo-root, so the whole stage is a single boundary (default)
   1     Parent Xform       The first parent typed ``Xform``
   2     Kind: Assembly     The first parent of kind ``assembly``
   3     Kind: Group        The first parent of kind ``group``
   4     Kind: Component    The first parent of kind ``component``, falling back to ``group``
   5     Kind: Model        The first parent of kind ``model``
   6     Kind: Subcomponent The first parent of kind ``subcomponent``, then ``component``, then ``group``
   7     Root Prim          Each root prim, that is each direct child of the pseudo-root
   8     Parent Prim        The first parent, whatever its type
   9     Original Prim      Each mesh itself, with results written beside the original rather than under it
   ===== ================== ================================================================================

Kinds are matched through the kind registry, so a mode also matches any kind derived from the one it
names. The values above are elective boundaries layered on top of the structural boundaries that
always apply: the pseudo-root, prims that are not ``def``, prims composed into an instanceable prim,
prims that reset the xform stack, and prims with a time sampled transform or visibility.


Arguments
---------

Static Meshes to Merge
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Optional list of prim paths to consider for merging

    - Name: ``meshPrimPaths``
    - Type: ``[string]``
    - Default Value: ``[]``

Keep Materials Separate
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Whether separate mesh prims will be created for each material that can be merged. When off, meshes with differing materials can be merged under a single mesh prim using GeomSubsets for each material.

    - Name: ``considerMaterials``
    - Type: ``bool``
    - Default Value: ``False``

Compute Display Colors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Set display color and opacity to values computed from the bound material

    - Name: ``materialAlbedoAsVertexColors``
    - Type: ``bool``
    - Default Value: ``False``

Original Mesh Handling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

What to do with any meshes in the original scene that were split or merged

    - Name: ``originalGeomOption``
    - Type: ``int``
    - Default Value: ``1``
    - Enum Values:
        - ``0: Ignore``
        - ``1: Delete``
        - ``2: Deactivate``
        - ``3: Hide``

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The boundary of where to merge meshes, for example, only merge meshes within a model

        - ``0: Stage``

        - ``4: Kind: Component``
        - ``5: Kind: Model``
        - ``6: Kind: Subcomponent``

Output Name
^^^^^^^^^^^

The output name to use for newly created merged meshes

    - Name: ``rootPath``
    - Type: ``str``
    - Default Value: ``""``

Strict Attribute Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When enabled all additional attributes on prims must match for them to be merged

    - Name: ``considerAllAttributes``
    - Type: ``bool``
    - Default Value: ``False``

Allow Single Meshes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When enabled means a single mesh will still be run through the merge process

    - Name: ``allowSingleMeshes``
    - Type: ``bool``
    - Default Value: ``False``

Spatial Clustering Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Enable spatial clustering of meshes by choosing a clustering method

    - Name: ``spatialMode``
    - Type: ``int``
    - Default Value: ``0``
    - Enum Values:
        - ``0: None``

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Maximum distance at which to consider meshes neighbors

    - Name: ``spatialThreshold``
    - Type: ``float``
    - Default Value: ``10``

Spatial Max Size
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Maximum size that clustered meshes can be grouped in

    - Name: ``spatialMaxSize``

    - Min Value: ``0.0``

Minimum Shared Vertices

    - Name: ``boundaryMinSharedVertices``
